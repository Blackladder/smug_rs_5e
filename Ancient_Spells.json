On a hit, a target takes poison damage equal to 12d10 + your spellcasting ability modifier. A hit target must then make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, for the next two minutes, that target takes 6d10 poison damage at the start of each of its turns and has disadvantage on saving throws. A creature affected by this spell makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends for it."
